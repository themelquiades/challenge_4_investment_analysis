# Fund Analysis
4th weekly challenge, focused on data prep, analysis, and visualizations for key risk and return metrics on various investment options. 

This analysis studied the performance, volatility, risk, Sharpe ratios, and betas for four different funds (managed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Soros Fund Managament LLC, Tiger Global Management LLC, and Soros Fund Management LLC) vs. the S&P 500

Through the analysis, we learned that the Berkshire Hathaway Fund had the best Sharpe Ratio, and therefore the best risk-adjusted returns while maintaining a relatively low beta to the S&P 500.
